to make,  cd to bin and type "make"
(the exe file called fitter should appear one dir above)

to run the example, cd to the example dirs
and run with ../../fitter <pdb1> <pdb2> <residue list>
where <pdb1/2> are the files provided the example dir
<residue list> is called cat_site.list there

about the input order:
the program fits the first structure so onto the second,
so as to improve the fit to residues from the second structure given in the list

the matrix for the improved alignemnt  is directed to stdout
