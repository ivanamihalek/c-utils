given a default igraph installation in /usr/local/lib
the pieces of code here are to be compiled with

gcc -o outname inname.c -I/usr/local/include/igraph -ligraph

this last assumes dynamic library linking, 
for which the LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to be set to

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
